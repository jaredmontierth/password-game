# password-game
I reverse-engineered the [Password Game](neal.fun/password-game) using Node.js and Express.js, and a computer vision tool called Chessvision.ai. The game involves complex, stacking rules for creating a password, and this bot automates the process of solving these rules. The bot interacts with several different APIs and tools to get through the stages of the game.
